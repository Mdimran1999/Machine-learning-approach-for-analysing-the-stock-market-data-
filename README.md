The financial market sector is characterized by complexity, volatility, and continual
evolution, prompting investors and traders to seek effective tools for gaining insights,
identifying opportunities, and managing risks. Technical analysis, focusing on historical price
and volume data to forecast future trends, stands out as a prominent strategy in market
research. Candlestick patterns and financial indicators play vital roles in interpreting market
behavior, offering insights into sentiment, reversals, and momentum. This research explores
the integration of candlestick patterns and financial indicators within forecasting models,
aiming to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions. Leveraging Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) models, known for capturing sequential dependencies, the study
investigates their effectiveness in predicting stock prices using Open, High, Low, and Close
(OHLC) data. Additionally, the research introduces the Graph Attention Network (GAT)
model to optimize stock market analysis, capturing complex relationships inherent in
financial markets. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning ten years and encompassing
OHLC prices of multiple companies, the project conducts detailed analysis and modeling.
Goals include identifying candlestick patterns, interpreting financial indicators, and
developing machine learning classifiers for predicting intraday stock patterns. By
empowering market participants with actionable insights from sophisticated data analysis
techniques, this research contributes to understanding financial market complexities and
facilitating informed decision-making.
